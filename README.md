# ReenbitTask
Hello,
unfortunately I cannot register for trial period on Azure.
Thats why, all saving functions save file in local pc
For stable work You need to create folder with name <Files> in parent folder to folder with project
Example:
Path to folder with project ...\MainFolder\Reenbit\ReenbitTask
Path to <Files> folder ...\MainFolder\Reenbit\Files
Thanks for attention
